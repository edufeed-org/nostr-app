   - Comprehensive landing page

3. **Technical Features**:
   - Custom Nostr event kinds (31000, 31001, 31002) for events, RSVPs, and updates
   - Hooks for querying and managing Nostr events
   - Integration with the Nostr protocol
   - Responsive UI using TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui components

The application provides a complete solution for planning and discovering events on the Nostr network. Users can create events, RSVP to events, view events on a map, and receive notifications for upcoming events they've RSVP'd to.

All tests are passing successfully, indicating that the application is ready for use.
